## Description
“Guess the Headline” is a dynamic tool designed to help users improve their headline-writing skills by guessing the headlines of various articles. This project involved the entire development process from ideation to deployment.

● I designed the wireframe for the quiz and developed the frontend using HTML and Tailwind CSS. I focused on creating a responsive and intuitive user interface that provides a seamless experience across devices.

● I wrote JavaScript code to dynamically generate quiz questions from a JSON file. The quiz features an engaging card-based UI where articles are displayed, and users can guess the headline before revealing the correct answer.

● I implemented a contact form for user queries and feedback. Social media sharing buttons were also integrated to enhance user interaction.

● I was responsible for deploying the application on Vercel, ensuring it was connected to a custom domain.
